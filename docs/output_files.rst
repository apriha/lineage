Output Files
============
The various output files produced by ``lineage`` are detailed below. Output files are saved in
the output directory, which is defined at the instantiation of the :class:`~lineage.Lineage`
object. Generation of output files can usually be enabled or disabled via a ``save_output``
argument to the associated method.

Save SNPs
---------
See `here <https://snps.readthedocs.io/en/latest/output_files.html#save-snps>`_.

Find Discordant SNPs
--------------------
Discordant SNPs between two or three individuals can be identified with
:meth:`~lineage.Lineage.find_discordant_snps`. One CSV file is optionally output when
``save_output=True``.

discordant_snps_<name1>_<name2>_GRCh37.csv
``````````````````````````````````````````
Where ``name1`` is the name of the first :class:`~lineage.individual.Individual` and
``name2`` is the name of the second :class:`~lineage.individual.Individual`.

================  ===========
Column            Description
================  ===========
rsid              SNP ID
chrom             Chromosome of SNP
pos               Position of SNP
genotype_<name1>  Genotype of first individual
genotype_<name2>  Genotype of second individual
================  ===========

discordant_snps_<name1>_<name2>_<name3>_GRCh37.csv
``````````````````````````````````````````````````
Where ``name1`` is the name of the first :class:`~lineage.individual.Individual`,
``name2`` is the name of the second :class:`~lineage.individual.Individual`, and ``name3`` is
the name of the third :class:`~lineage.individual.Individual`.

Find Shared DNA
---------------
Shared DNA between two or more individuals can be identified with
:meth:`~lineage.Lineage.find_shared_dna`. One PNG file and up to two CSV files are output when
``save_output=True``.

In the filenames below,

- ``name1`` is the name of the first :class:`~lineage.individual.Individual`
- ``name2`` is the name of the second :class:`~lineage.individual.Individual`
- ``cM_threshold`` corresponds to the same named parameter of
  :meth:`~lineage.Lineage.find_shared_dna`; "." is replaced by "p" with precision of 2, e.g., "0p75"
- ``snp_threshold`` corresponds to the same named parameter of
  :meth:`~lineage.Lineage.find_shared_dna`
- ``genetic_map`` corresponds to the same named parameter of
  :meth:`~lineage.Lineage.find_shared_dna`.

.. note:: If more than two individuals are compared, all :class:`~lineage.individual.Individual`
          names will be included in the filenames and plot titles using the same conventions.

.. note:: Genetic maps do not have recombination rates for the Y chromosome since the Y
          chromosome does not recombine. Therefore, shared DNA will not be shown on the Y
          chromosome.

````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
This plot illustrates shared DNA (i.e., no shared DNA, shared DNA on one chromosome, and shared
DNA on both chromosomes). The centromere for each chromosome is also detailed. Two examples of
this plot are shown below.

In the above plot, note that the two individuals only share DNA on one chromosome. In this plot,
the larger regions where "No shared DNA" is indicated are due to SNPs not being available in
those regions (i.e., SNPs were not tested in those regions).

.. image:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apriha/lineage/main/docs/images/shared_dna_User4583_User4584_0p75cM_1100snps_GRCh37_CEU.png

In the above plot, the areas where "No shared DNA" is indicated are the regions where SNPs were
not tested or where DNA is not shared. The areas where "One chromosome shared" is indicated are
regions where the individuals share DNA on one chromosome. The areas where "Two chromosomes
shared" is indicated are regions where the individuals share DNA on both chromosomes in the pair
(i.e., the individuals inherited the same DNA from their father and mother for those regions).
Note that the regions where DNA is shared on both chromosomes is a subset of the regions where
one chromosome is shared.

If DNA is shared on one chromosome, a CSV file details the shared segments of DNA.

If DNA is shared on two chromosomes, a CSV file details the shared segments of DNA.

chrom    Pair of chromosomes with matching DNA segment
start    Start position of matching DNA segment on each chromosome

Find Shared Genes
-----------------
Shared genes (with the *same genetic variations*) between two or more individuals can be
identified with :meth:`~lineage.Lineage.find_shared_dna`, with the parameter ``shared_genes=True``.
In addition to the outputs produced by `Find Shared DNA`_, up to two additional CSV files are
output that detail the shared genes when ``save_output=True``.

In the filenames below, ``name1`` is the name of the first
:class:`~lineage.individual.Individual` and ``name2`` is the name of the second
:class:`~lineage.individual.Individual`. (If more individuals are compared, all
:class:`~lineage.individual.Individual` names will be included in the filenames using the same
convention.)

````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
If DNA is shared on one chromosome, this file details the genes shared between the individuals
on at least one chromosome; these genes are located in the shared DNA segments specified in
`shared_dna_one_chrom_<name1>_<name2>_<cM_threshold>cM_<snp_threshold>snps_GRCh37_<genetic_map>.csv`_.
